# Docker_Nginx

I was working on a project where I took 1 week just to set-up SSL in my Nginx container. So I'm sharing this blog so that in future it will be helpful for the one who is now reading this.<br> I have a basic **Node application**, which is containerized with **Docker** and an **Nginx** container for SSL configuration. <br>
